    "***This is a brief guide to Python for users with a knowledge of another language and familiarity with recursion (for example, AP CSA students towards the end of the academic year). It uses minimax, a recursive algorithm which is well explained between 11:19 and 20:57 in [CS50 Minimax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eey91kzfOZs&ab_channel=CS50).  If you're unfamiliar with minimax, it is highly recommended that you watch that part of the video first.\n",
    "<br> The first part of the guide will focus on non-OOP concepts, and I'll introduce some basic OOP Python basics along with the OOP version of the game in the second part.  The OOP version is, in my opinion, cleaner and easier to write since the key aspects of the game's state can be shared among the methods of the class (ie, we don't have to think as hard about which functions need which arguments), but I will present it separately in order to make the exposition more gradual.***"
